Q6. Objective:
To gather and analyze comprehensive flight information for long-distance flights (over 6000 km) that have senior passengers (age 70 and above). This query is designed to assist in evaluating service provisions, operational efficiency, and passenger demographics on such flights, facilitating better planning and resource allocation for these specific scenarios.
Data Ordering:
•	Sort the results primarily by flight_id in ascending order for systematic reporting.
•	Secondary sorting by passengerid also in ascending order to organize data by individuals within the same flight.
Expected Outcome:
A detailed report showcasing key aspects of flights that meet the specified criteria, presented in a structured format that highlights the operational and demographic details pertinent to managing long-distance flights with elderly passengers. This report will aid airlines in enhancing passenger care, adjusting service offerings, and optimizing overall flight logistics for this specific passenger segment.
